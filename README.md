# BloggingApp
Udemy Flask Demo
from : https://www.udemy.com/course/python-flask-beginners/learn/lecture/9280482

Problem statement:
1. A user should be able to register an account and perform a login
2. Registered users should be able to create / edit / delete a blog
3. Any site visitor should be able to see a blogpost by all users

Approach to building the app:
1. Design a DB for the App & Create Tables
2. Design Endpoints for the App : /register /login etc
3. Build the App frontend - create routes
4. Develop the backend - handle all requests

TODO: fix security, validate inputs, add on additional use cases
I used this code as an exercise to migrate to Django using ChatGPT as well.
